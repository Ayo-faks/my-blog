I am a self-taught, Freelance creative AI Developer with experience in Web development, MLOps, and NLP. I empower data scientists, and businesses to make accurate decisions about their business.
I am comfortable working with Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Hugging face, and JavaScript to deliver exceptional customer solutions.

I have added intelligence to a customer care agency application, assisting agents and reducing average call times by 10-15 seconds. This expanded their customer sentiment visibility from 12% to 100% and provided a 5x increase in response to recommended product solutions, resulting in increased monthly revenue.

I am also a music producer and have worked in the advertising/entertainment industry for over 10 years. During that time, I worked with various big brands and produced award-winning Jingles including the Big brother Naija theme song.
